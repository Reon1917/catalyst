## ðŸ“‹ Technical Decisions Made
- Used timestamp + random suffix for ID generation (better uniqueness than just timestamp)
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for localStorage operations
- Added client-side safety checks for SSR compatibility
- Used Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive styling
- Followed Next.js App Router conventions for file structure
- Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for all components and pages
- Used React hooks for state management in client components
- Implemented Aceternity UI gradient effects for enhanced visual appeal
- Added campaign status calculation based on dates
- Used nested object handling for complex form data structures
- **Established strict TypeScript practices for production builds**
- **Implemented centralized type management to avoid conflicts**
- **Added proper React ref typing patterns for DOM interactions**
- **Used type-safe event handling throughout the application**

## ðŸ”§ TypeScript Error Resolution Summary
During the latest session, we systematically resolved critical build errors:

### 1. Search Filter Type Compatibility
- **Issue**: Generic `Record<string, unknown>` vs specific `SearchFilters` interface
- **Solution**: Imported proper interface and updated function signatures
- **Learning**: Always use specific interfaces over generic types for better type safety

### 2. Campaign Type Conflicts
- **Issue**: Local interface conflicting with imported Campaign type
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate definition, used single source of truth
- **Learning**: Centralize type definitions to avoid naming conflicts

### 3. Form Data Type Mismatches
- **Issue**: Handler expecting generic type vs component requiring specific interface
- **Solution**: Aligned types between parent and child components
- **Learning**: Maintain strict interface contracts across component boundaries

### 4. Optional Property Handling
- **Issue**: Confusion between `null` and `undefined` for optional properties
- **Solution**: Used `undefined` for optional properties as per TypeScript semantics
- **Learning**: Optional properties (`?:`) default to `undefined`, not `null`

### 5. React Ref Type Safety
- **Issue**: Generic `useRef(null)` incompatible with typed hook expectations
- **Solution**: Added proper generic typing and nullable ref handling
- **Learning**: React refs require explicit typing for DOM element references

### 6. DOM Event Type Casting
- **Issue**: `EventTarget` incompatible with DOM method expectations
- **Solution**: Added null checks and proper type assertions
- **Learning**: DOM APIs often require careful type management with event targets

### 7. Safe Object Spreading
- **Issue**: Spreading potentially undefined objects in state updates
- **Solution**: Added type guards and validation before spreading
- **Learning**: Always verify object existence before spread operations

## ðŸ”„ Ready for Next Phase
